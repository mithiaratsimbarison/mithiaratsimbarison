# 👋 Hi, Nice to meet you! 

I’m a dual-degree student in Digital Engineering & Management, currently studying at EDHEC Business School and Université de Technologie de Compiègne (UTC). I love working at the intersection of finance and data science, applying quantitative methods to solve real-world problems in financial markets and risk management. Last semester, I studied abroad in China, where I carried out several data analysis projects that gave me hands-on experience with large datasets and statistical modeling. My career goal is to work in financial markets, combining my finance knowledge with my technical skills to create meaningful impact.
